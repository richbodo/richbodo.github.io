Hi!

Here you will find Rich Bodo's creative works.

I'm currently porting my [pbworks site][pbworks-site] to [github pages][github-pages], which hosts the pages you are reading now.

That porting process is going to take a while, but I have a few of my short stories here already.  The rest is being automated.

While I port my stuff over, I'm having a lot of fun exploring the limits of github pages and writing little tools to use github to make the creative writing process more efficient and palatable to techies.  It's a project in itself, which is a lot of fun.  [My notes on that are here.][github-creatives]

Thank you very much for visiting.  Although I could not stop myself from producing creative works if I tried, your feedback is the air that my works breath.  I will respond to anyone who gets in touch with a comment, request, or, well, anything at all. 

All the best.

Sincerely,

-Rich
