Hi!

Here you will find Rich Bodo's creative works.

I'm currently porting this content from my [pbworks site][pbworks-site] to [github pages][github-pages].  Github pages hosts the pages you are reading now.

That porting process is going to take a while, but I have a few of my short stories here already.

While I port my stuff over, I am exploring the limits of github pages, and writing tools that make writing fiction easier for me.  That's a project in itself.  [My notes on that are here.][github-creatives]

Your feedback would be awesome.  Anyone who gets in touch will get a response.  Thanks for reading.

All the best.

Sincerely,

-Rich
