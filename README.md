This repo is basically becoming my personal homepage, and an experiment in creative writing on github.

You can view the github pages site at http://richbodo.com.

All my coding projects are individually licensed with a free culture license of some kind.  My creative writing, at the moment, is just copyright me, until I get good enough at it that someone actually reads it and things like licenses start to matter, at which point I will have to figure out what the right thing to do is.
