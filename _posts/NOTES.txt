Sections
--------

Probably have three sections:

* Writing - Writing is my reward each day for doing the right thing.  I can only do it in that frame of mind.

* Code - I love/hate coding.  I love it when something comes together, and I love working with others, and I love it when I save time - so coding is a means to a lot of ends for me, I suppose.  I would rather be writing.

* Other Projects - Like you, I have too many projects.  Actually, I probably have more than you do, I just haven't listed them all here because that's another unfinished project of mine.  Come revel in the large number of unfinished projects I tell myself I'm too busy to complete.


Writing Tags
------------

I need to automate a way to grab all the tags out and make an html page with clickable tags,
or find someone elses solution.
